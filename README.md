# nodal-python
Graph theory and Dijstra's visualized
Intended for visualization, not at all optimized
for large networks

CURRENT NODE WILL APPEAR ORANGE

CONTROLS
LClick: create new node
RClick: link current node to hovered-over node
Shift: select node (hold to drag)
<- ->: add weight between current node and hovered-over node's edge
Space: If over neighbor node, delete edge
       If over current node, delete current node
d: initiate Dijkstra's with goal as hovered-over node
